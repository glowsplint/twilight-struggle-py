# twilight-struggle-py
Python port of Twilight Struggle

We're creating a python port of Twilight Struggle which will be a barebones (command-line, no graphics) implementation of the game. The purpose of this project is to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm that would be a stronger computer player than the natively implemented one.
